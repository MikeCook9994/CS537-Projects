Implementation Details:
The goal of the project was to implement threading in the xv6 operating system. This included the modification of existing
system code as well as the inclusion of new system calls. A user library also needed to be written to provide the user with a
means of actually creating threads. Conditions Variables and locks were also implemented in the project.
