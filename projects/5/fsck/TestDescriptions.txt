BadDirectory: Two directories do not have . and .. in them. You should add these directory entries and ensure the directories have the correct size. You will need to know the directories' parent in order to properly set the inum for the .. link. This means you will probably need to navigate the directory tree and keep track of the current parent.

BadLinkCount: An inode has an incorrect link count. You should make a list of link counts for each inode and fix the inode whose link count is not correct. For directories, the .. link counts towards the link count while the . entry does not.

BadType: An inode has an invalid type (valid types can be found in include/stat.h. Unused inodes are of type 0). The inode should be cleared and the directory entries that include that inum should be zeroed out.

BlockNotFree: Some blocks are not referenced by any inode but are not free. You should find any discrepancies between the inode pointers and the bitmap. You only need to consider pointers that are currently in use by the file (you only need to consider the first one if the file size is <= 512, the first two if file size is < 1024, etc.)

NoReferenceInode: One inode is not referenced by any directory. It should be moved into the folder lost+found. The name of the file in lost+found does not matter (you may choose).

BadSuperBlock: Check the fields on the superblock. Both the inode and data block fields are much larger than the size of the image. Print "Error\n" and exit as no recovery is possible.

WrongSize: The size in the superblock is incorrect. You can fix this by using linux system calls to stat the image and get the size of the file. The size that goes into this field is in terms of the number of blocks.
