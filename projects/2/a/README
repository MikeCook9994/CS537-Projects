I did not work on this project with Giang. It is not reflective of his efforts.

An attempted implementation of a basic unix shell in C. The shell, in its current state, supports cd, pwd, and exit as
executed from the application from itself. It also currently supports the execution of any other application with arguments.
It does not currently support IO redirections (>, >>, % (which is an operator for the unix tee utility), | (up to two pipes))

Honestly, I didn't get the project done before the deadline and never found time to finish it. I am currently in the process of
implementing the program in C++ as an intro to the language.
