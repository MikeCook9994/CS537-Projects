Implementation Details:
An implementation of FSCK, that checks an xv6 file system image for corruption. The program checks the super block for valid
data and fixes it in the event that it can be done. Following, a number of other checks are made over the inode metadata
including the file type, the number of references, etc... Other checks are made to ensure that unreferenced inodes are moved
to the lost and found directory as well as verify that any bad inodes are cleared and their data blocks freed. There is a lot
of stuff that is checked such that it's difficult to describe all of it here. Honestly, the project was very complicated and 
was not entirely complete as it was kinda assigned during our finals week. 95% of the work is done and is correct.
